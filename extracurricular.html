        <h4>At SFMS, students have the opportunity to take a variety of connections classes that expose them to the various pathways that they can choose in high school and beyond. Students have two periods of connections a day in compliment to their academic classes. 9-week connection classes are not "electives", which means that they are randomly assigned and can not be requested. This allows students to have experiences with classes that they may not originally choose, but may ignite a hidden passion.  </h4>
